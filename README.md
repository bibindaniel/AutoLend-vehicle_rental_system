# AutoLend-vehicle_rental_system
This web-based mini project is designed to streamline the process of renting vehicles for both owners and renters. By providing a platform for clients to list their vehicles for rent, the project aims to connect individuals in need of a vehicle with those who have one to spare.

Clients will have the ability to list their vehicles for rent, including details such as make, model, year, images, rental cost, and availability. They can also set their own rental terms and conditions. Users will be able to search and view available vehicles, filter by make, model, rental cost, location etc., and then proceed to rent the vehicle of their choice. They can also check the reviews and ratings of the vehicle and the owner before booking.

The project will include a user-friendly interface, easy navigation, and search options to make the process of renting a vehicle as simple as possible. It will also include a secure payment system, so users can make payments safely and easily. The booking system will be simple and easy to use, allowing both clients and users to manage their bookings and reservations with ease.

This project aims to provide an alternative for individuals who do not own a vehicle or need a temporary replacement, while also providing a source of income for vehicle owners. Additionally, it will help to reduce the traffic congestion on the roads by providing an alternative mode of transportation.

Overall, this web-based mini project will provide an efficient and convenient solution for both vehicle owners and renters. It will make the process of renting a vehicle more accessible, affordable, and secure for everyone involved. This will be a win-win situation for both parties as vehicle owners can earn extra income by renting out their idle vehicles and renters can rent a vehicle at a fraction of the cost of buying one.
